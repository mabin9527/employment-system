## Design

### Colors

I chose a light grey as the nav-bar background color and an extremely clean white color as the background color. The text color would be normal black. Because as an online working platform, the HR or employees' attention should not be abstracted by the colorful design. 

The colors I wanted to stay close to  [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

### Fonts

 The fonts selected were from Google Fonts, Montserrat wits sans-serif as a backup font.


#### Website pages

The site was designed for the user to be familiar with the classic office applications such as a navigation bar along the top of the pages and a hamburger menu button for smaller screens. Besides, the operation interface is easy to learn which will save plenty of time and costs for the owner. Because it is not necessary to train new employees on how to use this platform.

- The site consists of the following pages:
  - The login page allows the user to get access to the platform
  - The admin page shows the admin's username 
  - The admin edit page allows the user to update the admin's username and password saved from the database
  - The department page displays the current consist of departments in the company
  - The employee page can be used to add, edit and delete employee detail

 #### Database

- Built with Python and the Django framework with a database of a Postgres for the deployed Heroku version(production)
- The database ER diagram and table show all the fields stored in the database
